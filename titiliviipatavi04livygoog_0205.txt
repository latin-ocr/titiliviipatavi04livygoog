LIBER lll. 193

‘polum ai in senatu per santionem non liceat. Neque enim
‘sibi privatos aut in carih, ant in concione, posse obstare;
¹ ‘neque se imaginariis fascibus eornm cessuros esse! Tum
l Appius, jam prope essa ratus, ut, ni violentiae eorum pari
resisteretur audaciis, victum imperinm esset: ⁶ Non erit me·
¹ ‘lina’ inquit, ‘ nisi de quo consulimus, vocem misisse ¹.' Et
ad Valerium, negantem aa privato reticere ², lictorem accedere
jussit. Jam Quiritium fidem implorante Valerio a cudae
limine, I.. Cornelius completus Appium, nou, simulabat quod,
eonsulendo ³, diremit certamem factaque per Cornelium Va·
levio dicendi gratia, quae vellet, quum libertas nou ultra vo·
aem excessisset, decemviri propositum tenuere. Consulares
quhqueacaeniores ab residuotribuniciae potestatis odio ⁴,‘ou·
‘jus desiderium plebi multo acrius, quhm consularis imperii‚'
rebantur ⁴ esae‚’ prope malebant, postmodo ipsos decemviros
vuluntate abire magistratu, quam invidiis eorum exsurgere rur·

¹ Non, dc. It vvill not he for the advantage of any senator, that
he has uttered swerd, except ou the subject, about which vvs are corr-
rultingyou. ¹ Reticere privato, to keep silence sora rnan in eprivate
station. ¹ In thiedifflcult passage, a number os the Μ SS., Stroth and
Ruperti read qnod ,· Stroth explaining ir, Appius did ndt consult the
terrete further about the avar, about which he pretended still to consult
them Sigonius, and almost all the ethereditors read cul, with thia
meaning: Cornelius, hy providiug for the salety ot⁴ Appius (in reality,) ⁴
for whose sasety he pretended that he did not intend to provida-hia
pretence being that he wished to provide lor the easety ol Valerius.
l should he inclined to retain Stroth’s reading with s different reser-
ence. The decemvirs wished to consult the senate about the war,
Valerius about the condition ol* the atate. The decemvirs ultimately
prerailed-propoaitum terruere, worda inconsistent vvith Stroth’a inter-
pretation. But this was done by Appius pretending to yield to Va·
letius, and consult the senate de republica. He accordingly gare Va·
letius an opportunity ol* speaking on that subject, aa if it weseformal-
ly before the senate, hut no more. 'Ihe words then would mean, By
Appius not consulting the senate on the general question ol the state's
condition, whilst by alloning Valerius to apeslr he pretended to do se.
⁴ θοήται, (see p. 58, note 2.) odium, gratia, invidio, and other noune
expressive of affectione ol the mind, are used irrdifferently in an active
or a passive sense. odiam potestatis is here passive: hatred suffered
hythe power. So in a sentence in the tud Chapter, per invidiam de·
remeirolern, through hetred suffered by,-tovvards the decemvirs: it
might likevvise mean through hetred mocerdiagsrora-felt hythe de-
cemvirs. So in English, the love ot* uod3 either acsivelythelose
tmanating from God, or passively love towards Gad.
