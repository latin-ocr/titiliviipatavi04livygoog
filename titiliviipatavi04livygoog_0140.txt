⁸ The accuracy of this account of the conduct, and almost total extinc-
tion of the Fabian family, as given in the 481h, terh, and sort chap-
ters, hasbeen frequently and deservedly called in question. Diony-
sius asserta, that the total number of the Fabian army amounted, from
the clients and retainers who joined in the expedition, to 4000 men,
und aslis. with great truth, if it is at all probable that 306 men should
hare had no male children to leave behind st Rome, but one? He
therefore thinlrs, that the report as to the single boy, originated in the
circumstance of his having been the most distinguished in the subse·
quent rece of the Fabii. Perizonius, with great appearance of croth,
doubts both accounts, from the extreme improbability ol one Patrician
family at'llomemustering so strong as 306, at so short a period after
the expulsion of Tarquin, whose well-known policy it was to thiu, as
much as possible, the ranks of the patriciam, ond from the fact, that,
with every disposition to exalt this noble family, the Roman people had ¹
raised only three of their number to the consulship, during the seren
preceding years, whilst, on the other hand, all the subsequent Fabii
are uniformly, in &man history, traced to this one remaining bruach.
'lhe extraordinsry number of 306, he supposes to have been 'made of
the clients; and that the whole body were, in the ancient records or
monuments, called Fabii, und hence the blunder into which Liry has

fallen.
