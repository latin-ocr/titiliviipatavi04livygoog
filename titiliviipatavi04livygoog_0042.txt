Valerius Publicola, we learn from 11. 8, first introduced appeals
even from the magistrates during the republic. Tullus therefore takes
advantage of an old law, (Livy could not have said Tullo clemente legis
interprete, il' Tullus had made the law,) provided for cases ot’ treason
against the state, iu which the ultimate decision of state charges was
properly left ιο the people. Rene peruetusta dicebatur qui se qnoque
moda hostii animuin rempublicam aare declnrdttet· Venno. Horatius
was, at the time he committed the deed, inrested with nu Important
public office, aud therefore could with propriety he styled a rena pcr-
duellr'nnir, as he had exposed the state in his public capacity to the
wrsth of heaven. The terms of the law left no option ιο the Duum-
riri, to whom, as a preliminary step, thepassing of the sentence only
ivae antrusted, qui perduellionem judicent. They at once, without con-
'sidering his guilt or innocence, doum him ιο death as a traitor. This
brings the matter before the people as a crime against them, by ap·
peal not irom the sentence of the King, but that of the Dunmnr'ri, end
seems to havebeen the first time the law was acted upon, as Dionysius
expressly states that the people had never before decided on a ca·
pital case. ¹ De praevocatione certatam ert. This would mean, the
point was debated with regnrd to the appeal. 'dhe expression evi·
dently correspouds ιο the clause in the law provocatione tuturo, ,and
indicates, that in consequence os the appeal‚ the parties debuted the
cnse. Perhaps, as Faber suggests, the reading should be itaque. One
