XLVIII. Turbatores vulgi erant Spurii Maecilius quar-
tism et Metilius tertium tribuni plebis, ambo absentes creati.
Et quum rogationem promulgissent, ‘ut ager ex hostibus
‘captus viritior divideretur‚' magnaeque partis nobilium eo
plebiscito publicarentur fortunam (nec euim ferme quicquam
agri, ut iu urbe alieno solo positi, non armis parturn erat;
nec, ‘ qnod venisset assignatumve publice esset,’ praeterquam
plebs babebat ¹) atrox plebi Patribusque propositum videba-
tur certamen: nec tribuni militum, nuncin senatu, nunc in
conciliis privatis principum cogendis, viam consilii invenie·

dixisse, ‘ Vetus se ac familiare eonsilium domo afferre. Pro·

¹ Duedng and=Ruperti both explain this as meaning, Nor bad the
plebcIans had any other lund, but what had been sold or publicly as-
signed. But this seems erroneous; l. Because it violates the ns·
tural order cf the words. 2. Because it weakens the inferenee drawn
by the nobility from the proposed law. The division of the enemy's
land affected them, because their right to ull their lunds was that oi
conquest: this applled to them all, or nearly all, nugetur pnrtt's. And
the reason gisen is, that it was almostimpossible to have land, notlsub-
ject to the law, from the position ol Rome, whilst nobody could be
exempted t'rom its operation on the¹plea of pubIIc sanctIon, except
plebeians. as they alone had so obtaIned it. 3. Both critics have ae-
glected the subjunctive, which seems to indicate that en exception was
made in the law of favour of those who bad acquired lends in the
manner mentioned in tbe clause. The sentence then seems to hare
this import‚ Nor did any except the plebeians possess land, ‘which
(came under this excepting clause oi the law, on the ground that it)
⁴ hsd been sold or pubIIcly assigned to them.’ ² The order os ascend
is given by Plautus. Pater, urus, proavus, abavus, atavus, tritavus.
lt Ap. Claudius was the grandson nithe decemvir, he must have been
the abacos of the Claudius who gives this esemel, 11. 44. Glareaa
thinks, improbably‚ thatfllius should be substituted for nepos. Itis
more likely that Livy used tbc word proavus loosely. ⁸ Nouos,
apparently not ln the sense mentioned p. 40. notes, but simply mea
of no standIng. ⁴ Pro, dac. 'Ibat their spirit avus ss lowly as their

’ lortune.
