ted to be tried l'or their lives. This question is sbly argued by Hoohe
inhis Roman History, ii. la ¹ ln the preceding note, a dille-
rence between Dionysius aad Livy bas been noticed. ln this sentence
Livy is accused of differing from himself. Crevier censures him lor
inconsistency, in steting that the proposed change iu the mode of elect·
ing tribunes wer hond parva rer. and yet in tbe eom Chapter essert.
ς ing that it was res maior victorici crescenti certaminis, quam asu. Hoolra
endeavours to obviate the charge, by supposing that Livy had in view
tvo distinct effecta of the change, in the two sentences. This obvious·
ly leaves the matter where it was. We must either, therefore, leave
the imputation unenswered, cr understand, as 1 have done, not that
ferebatur means, ⁶ Α matter of no small importsnce roos prepared:
(which is evidently the meaning attached to the word by Crevier and
lincke) but, ⁶ tbe matter was said by thc Patricium to deone of no
'small importance.' There seems, in reality, to have been but little
difference in the result of the two modes of electiora, and the change,
therefore, wasone of no practical importunes. 'l'he Patricium, hosv-
ever, thought otherwise, being anxious to secure aristocratic tribunes,
(see speech of Appius, cnsp. lala) and their fears are expressed in this
sentence; in the sentence in the 60111 Chapter, Livy expresses bis own.
lt may herc be shortly noticed, that critice have been puzzled hythe
sentence sed quae, dre. taking it for granted that the tribunes had been
previously elected in the Comitia Curiata, where ench individual vote
counted. 'Ihe change to the Padurn. then, where lihewise each indi· ·
vidnal counted, would maire no change on the saffrcgia clientium.
Altbough it is uniformly asserted, on tbe authority of Dionysius, that
the tribum were elected in the Comitia Curiata, (see p. lov. note 2)
yet Livy does not seem so to have understood, and in this passage
clearly indicates his opinion to have been, that they were elected in the
Consule centuriata, where the intluence of the Patricians on the higher
ranke of voters, their clienta, might be supposed by them to give them
the preponderance. see Chap. at, where Livy says, Irata plebs in.
