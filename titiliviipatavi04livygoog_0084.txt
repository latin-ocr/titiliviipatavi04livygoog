¹ This truditioual conjecture has been combeted with great success
by Dr Hunter. It is his opinion, thut by the terme Patres conscripti
· were meent, agreeably to their litarsl impert, the fathers whose names
‘were contained in the roll of the Senate who alone had a decisivo
⁸ voice, or the right of deciding on every question submitted ιο their

‘most respectful und honourahle forms of address, hut likewise to

ulterius. L. Tarquinius Collatinus. Tha account given by Livy of ’
the mother which instigated the Romana to deprive this noblemnn of
office seems improbable and inconsistent. If the mere circumstance
of thc name, aa connecting him with the Tarquin family, rendered him
an object of suspicion, Brutus was lilrewise liable to its effecta, be· l
ing connected with them by his mother. Dionysius narrctes the meritc
very differently. He narrator the hauishment of Collatinus us having ι
occurred aher the conspiracy, of which an account follows in the
next chcpters, and urtnbuter it ιο his having favoured Tarquin’e claims
to hie private property, and ιο his defence of hie nephews, the Aquillir'.

as if it belonged to his family hy inheritancc, to regain it.
