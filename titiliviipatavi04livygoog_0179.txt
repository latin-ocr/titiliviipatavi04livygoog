¹ Nam, &c We had now been captured and destroyed, is the La-
tios had not taken up arms of their own accord. lt will be obserred,
that both thc Latin and the English idioms employ the indicative,
(capti et deleti ernnrns. we iod been taken and destroyed) with a soree
equivalent to the subjunctive, (capti et deleti essemus, we should hove
bem taken and destroyed.) For this the philosophy oi grammar must
furuish us vvith some reason ; for, in the words ol Dr Hunter, ¹ Can it
‘ior a moment be supposed, thatun enlightened people. provided with
‘two forms ol the verb for the expression of two different and dis-
‘ tinet conceptione, should reject the form appropriate to one of them,
‘and employ, in preference, the other form, which did not correctly
‘aud adequatcly express the conception ?' The admirable strictures
os the writer now quoted, on the moods and tenses of the Greek and
Latin verb, furnish us with a lrey to the difficulty, The conclusion ιο
which vve come is, that in all passages similar to the one which we
shall now attempt to explain, tlte indicative contains the ideo involved
in the subjunctive. virt tlte additional sorte wlricb a positive astarten
los over o hypothetical one. Considering the flexions of the verbs in
Greek aod Latin, as either auriliary verbs, or similar to onr auxiliary
verbs, and that the English auxiliaries, may, can, do, bc„ being all
verbs in the indicative mood, when combined with a noun or subject,
express on assertion, Dr Hunter concludes, that the tenses of the Latin
potential or subjunctive, as well as the subjunctive and optative of the
Greek verb, vvhich involve these auxiliaries, and are literally rendered
into English by means ol them, also express an assertion, or, in other
words, are also indicative. It follows, that as the English auxiliaries
are all of the present tense, each of them having a correspondent l'orm
appropriated to post time, the flexione of the learned langunges, which
involve those auxiliaries. should also be either ot' the precem or of the
past tense. The following is a table ol the tenses, arranged according
to this view, modihed somewhat to suit the passage at present under
discussion:
