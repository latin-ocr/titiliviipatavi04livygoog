¹ These sentences from Placere have giren rise to much discussion.
Acro procedere hes been taken by some to mean, that years οἰ regular
service were to be imparted to the irregular servIoe oi the solunteer in·
damry, and tbe seme privilege hasbeen understood as bestowed on the
cavalry by centos nomena uerit· Equis mereri equites coeperunt, has
been amended, by omitting equis, by equit ruis, and equo suo, on the
saith of the languege used in the epitome, and the ground that the
equites never served exceptori horseback. The first two sentences do i
not require much notIce. It does not appear that any act of the se-
nate was necessary to stamp the privilege cI regnier service on that oi
the volunteers, eud the connexion between the two lust sentences it
so close es to render the Interpretation ebore given extremely impro-
bable. As to the Iast sentence there is in reality uo difficulty. Mene
involves merere stipendium, to earn pay. They then first earned or
received pay on horseback. It is not true that they never served on
scot. These who offered their services were oi plebeian ranis, (equi ἵ
publici non erem assignati.) end were obliged so to serve, when re- ’
quired. For these end other macons, which our ilmitsdonotallorr us to
enumerate, no emendation seems necessery, and the whole passage may
be thos¹ translated: But that it was the pleasureoI the senate, that pey
should run on from that date to those who had volunteered tbeIr eer-
vices, et a time when they were not legally required. To the borse-
men also a fixed rate of pay was assigned. Tbat nes tbe first occasion
on which the horsemen received pay, at leest In thet capacity. ¹ Iit-
pente, according to most commentatore, quelifiea eminentem ert.
