was going on st a past time: captus rum, my captureis over now,
captus want, my capture was over at a past time: captus aim, the con·
tingency of my capture is over now, captus essens, the contingency ot*
my capture was over at a past time. Without entering further into
the illustration of this doctrine, for which the render is referred to Dr
Hunter's Appendix to his edition of Ruddiman's Rudiments, we may
now apply it to the present passage. It contains two hypothetical
statements, the one afailure of the Latias to take up arms, and tlte
other the capture and destruction of the Romans, the one being de-
pendent on the other. Disregarding the negative, and the hypothe-
tical nature of the sentence, as well as altering the tense, we shall be
enabled to see the nature of the passage more clearly.
Latini sumunt arma, The taking up of arms by the Latios is going
vel sumpserunt, l on now, or-is over now.
si (sit) Grant that, it follows that
Capimur et delemur, vel} Our capture and destruction is going on
Capti et deleti cuntur, , now, or-is over now.
Give the sentence at once its hypothetical form, and we have
si Latini sumant arma, On thc contingency that the taking up of
vel sumpserint, Ξ mmsis goingon now, or-is over now;

capiemur& delebimm' vel {Onr capture and destruction is future

capti et deleti eximus, now, or-The futurity of our capture

and destruction is over now.
This last form leads directly to the form, copti et deleti snmus ,· for it the
futurity is over now, the event is decided ; and in strong language, by
the mental destruction ol the hypothesis, we may sapt our capture and
destruction is already over. In the same way,
Latini sumebant arma, Tne taking np of arms uvas going on at a

vel sumpserant, ξ past time, or-over at a past time.

si Grant that, it follows tlrat

Give the sentence at once its hypothetical form, and we hare

On the contingency tlrat the taking up ol
arms was going on at a past time, or-
was orer at a past time;

vel sumpsissent,

Capti et deleti essemus,

As before, this last form leads directly to the form 1n the text, capti et
deleti aramum ·for if the contingency of our capture and destruction
wasaover at the time when, hypothetically‚ the taking of arms was
oter, ἰ. e. nt s past time, in strong language we may say, tlrat not only
