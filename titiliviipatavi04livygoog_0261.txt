¹ Our limite do not permit us tu enter fully into the discussion of the
difficulty raised by Livy. This has been done at great length, aud
with great ingenuity‚ by Perizonius, in his Animadversionem Historicue.
lt may be briefly remurked, that Livy seems, out of compliment te
Augustus, to conceal his real opinion, and to express himself with
studied obscurity. 'ihs consent of all the ancient historiens—the
ntur confusion into which a change would thruw tha whole of the
Roman mosis, whose narratiou proceeds all along as if there were uo
doubt on the mutter,-the badly disguised opinion of Livy himself,-
the express authority of Varro, who states that a manipularis utiles
might obtain the spolia opimu,-and the weokness of the authority ad-
duced by Livy, as the inscription consul, was in all probability udd-
ed by the family of Cornelius at s subsequeut period, atter he had
really been consus-render it almost certain that Cossus was only tri.
boue of the soldiers at the time when he gained the spolio opima, and,
consequendy. that it was not vnecessary to be generales the Roman

anny in order to attaiu that highest of all military honours. ¹ Inv
order to protect the prayers of the people l'rom containing any thing

displeasing to the gods, the presiding priests, (here duumuiri. appoint-
ed to take charge os the Sibylliue booles) went over the words, which
vere repeated by the people.
